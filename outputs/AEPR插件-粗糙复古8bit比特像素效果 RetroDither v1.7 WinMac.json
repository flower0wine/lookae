    "description_en": "RetroDither is a GPU accelerated plugin for Adobe After Effects which allows to create stylized images with dithering and color schemes from retro game consoles and home computer platforms. You could call it ‘save GIF for web’ on steroids on first sight, but in fact RetroDithering is capable to do so much more, having more than 10 different ordered and errordiffusion dithering algorithms and color palettes varying from several adaptive to classic hardware ones, such as ZX spectrum, CGA, MSX and many more. Now you can do very authentic stylizing, if you’re trying to add some retro feeling into your motion graphics or footage."
