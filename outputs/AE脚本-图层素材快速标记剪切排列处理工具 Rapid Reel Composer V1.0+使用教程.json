Rapid Reel Composer will automatically split the selected layer into multiple short clips at the marker locations. You have two methods to choose from: the In-Out method and the ‘Lazy’ method. Rapid Reel Composer is loaded with various other convenient features that will save you time and streamline your workflow, reducing the need for repetitive tasks.",
