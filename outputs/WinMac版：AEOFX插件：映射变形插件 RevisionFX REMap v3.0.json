      "RE:Map UV": "takes a UV Map, probably rendered from a 3D system, and renders an image using this mapping. Easily clean up texture maps and remap in post without having to go back to your 3D system for re-rendering. In addition, this plugin allows you you to come up with cool 2D and 3D animated texture map templates and reuse them over again with different image sequences.",
      "RE:Map Inverse UV": "takes a UV Map and a color image that matches that UV Map, and inversely projects the color image to a rectangular image that may then be used to texture the UV Map with RE:Map UV, or for use as a texture map for your 3D system.",
      "RE:Map Distort": "takes a color image and automatically distorts the image based on the features for a caricature-like effect.",
      "RE:Map Displace": "warps an image with a user-supplied displacement map. This plugin includes many more options and advanced filtering controls than most other displacement map filters.",
      "RE:Map Planar": "maps or inverse maps a perspective plane defined by 4 points (also known as corner pinning)."
