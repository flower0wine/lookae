  "content": "该脚本用于删除由内置蒙版跟踪器生成的‘不必要的’关键帧。它会分析每帧的关键帧，并移除与前一关键帧相似度超过阈值的帧。过程分为两个阶段：删除和强化。删除阶段移除移动距离低于指定阈值的相邻关键帧；强化阶段在关键帧间移动过大时，重新插入被删除的关键帧，直到满足条件。最终将关键帧减少的百分比输出至信息面板。",

      "translated_content": "Allows you to remove ‘unnecessary’ keyframes generated by the built-in mask tracker. It will look at the mask’s tracker-generated every-frame keyframes and remove those frames that fall under a threshold of being similar to their predecessor. Two passes are executed: removal and reinforcement. The removal pass consists of removing keyframes that are too similar to the previous one. Two keyframes are considered similar when none of the vertices has moved more than the specified (removal) threshold. The reinforcement pass analyzes every successive pair of the remaining keyframes. When a vertex has moved more than the (reinforcement) threshold, a previously removed keyframe is reintroduced in the middle of the two keyframes. This phase is repeated until every pair satisfies the condition. The percentage of keyframe reduction is written to the Info palette."
