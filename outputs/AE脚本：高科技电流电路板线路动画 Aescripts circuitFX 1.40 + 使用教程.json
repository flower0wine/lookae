    "脚本简介": "circuitFX 是 AE 软件中一款高科技电流电路板线路动画脚本，能够随机生成各种电路图，脚本还可以创建CUP，电阻，电流器，芯片等，可以将这些部件放在同一个电路图层中或者单个图层中。控制操作简单直接，适用于制作HUD高科技背景动画等其他科技动画",
    "circuitFX 1.4 更新": "Added: size of the grid dots of the guide layer, is now always the same, no matter the size of the grid or the size of the comp. Also, an effect control slider has been added to further adjust the size if needed Added: new generation direction and strength options Fixed: pasting masks on the guide layer now positions them correctly, rather than putting them on the top left corner (0,0) Optimized: the “Avoid crossing of circuit lines” option is now checked by default on tool startup Optimized: circles size, circles stroke width, lines width as well as chips, capacitors and resistors initial size in now relative to the size of the grid Optimized: optimization of the circuit generation algorithm with noticeable speed improvements on all modes circuitFX is a tool for After Effects designed to create graphical circuit boards. The circuit pattern is generated randomly with every button press. Apart from the circuit lines and circles, circuitFX also creates, chips, resistors and capacitors. It has the ability to put all of the needed parts in a single shape layer or create separate shape layers for each part of the board. It ideal for technology or sci-fi related projects, animated backgrounds, HUDs etc.",
