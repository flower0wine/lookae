**【插件简介】**

Power Stroke 是 Digital Film Tools（简称DFT）公司出品的描边插件，

插件 Power Stroke 基于笔划互动的工作流程，快速，直观地进行有针对性的调整；

绘制精确的遮罩，无需繁琐的区域选择和复杂手动绘制，而是通过一些简单绘制来选择区域，

然后可以在画面中进行调色和混合，以确定你的目标区的描边边缘，

还可以添加效果：如色彩校正，重新着色或饱和度，黑白图像，模糊，补光，扩散/辉光等

**Digital Film Tools: Power Stroke AE** – Designed with the creative workflow of colorists, film/video editors, digital photographers, graphic designers and artists in mind, Power Stroke introduces a simple, interactive stroke-based workflow to quickly and intuitively perform targeted adjustments.

Based on the concepts of luminance-weighted chrominance blending and fast intrinsic distance computations, Power Stroke produces high-quality results at a fraction of the complexity and computational cost of previous techniques. At long last, gestural selection and image adjustment have been combined into one natural, fast and easy process.

Instead of meticulously selecting regions or handpainting masks, regions of interest are isolated by drawing a few simple brush strokes with adjustments then made only in those areas.

Instead of meticulously drawing exact masks, using inaccurate matte extractions or hand painting frame to frame, regions of interest are isolated by drawing a few simple and loose After Effects open or closed masks. Power Stroke then uses the concepts of luminance-weighted chrominance blending and fast intrinsic distance computations to determine the edges of your target area and adjustments are made only in those areas. Masks can be assigned multiple corrections and effects such as color correction, recoloring or desaturation, colorization of black and white images, blur, fill light for dimly lit image areas and diffusion/glow.
