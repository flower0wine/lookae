RE:Vision Effects, acclaimed effects plug-in industry leader and makers of Academy Award winning software, announces DE:Noise™ version 3 for After Effects, Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Motion, Vegas Pro, Nuke, Scratch, Fusion, HitFilm, DaVinci Resolve and Natron.

DE:Noise handles spurious frame-to-frame defects ranging from fine sensor noise to blotchy spots (e.g. dirt on film). DE:Noise combines motion estimation techniques with feature-sensitive, edge-preserving spatial filtering methods to reduce the visual impact of various problems such as: noisy video (common with low-light capture), excessive film grain, CG renders affected by ray-tracing sampling artifacts, fingerprints and dust captured during film scan/transfer and printing, snow, drop-outs, flash frames and many other defects.

DE:Noise v3 introduces a new noise-reducing filter that greatly improves results for shots with object edges and features greatly damaged by compression, rendering and noisy camera capture artifacts.

DE:Noise v3 also adds GPU support. Speedups up to 4.5x on GPUs when using DE:Noise have been measured over running DE:Noise in CPU mode, already known for its speed. Speedups of this magnitude are usually seen with higher end cards. Note that most currently-sold GPUs will provide customers with needed acceleration, including many mobile GPUs for laptops. Of course, the total speedup end-users will see will vary once application overhead is taken into account: this includes disk I/O, internal host buffering schemes, bandwidth of PCIe bus, codec used for footage, etc

**Compatibility**

Adobe After Effects CS5 and up, and Adobe CC versions.

Adobe Premiere Pro CS5 and up, and Adobe CC versions.

Vegas Pro 11 and up, 64-bit only.

Resolve v11 and up.

Nuke, 5.1 v2 and up,, 64-bit versions only

Fusion 5.2 and up, 64-bit versions only

Assimilate Scratch v5.1 and up
