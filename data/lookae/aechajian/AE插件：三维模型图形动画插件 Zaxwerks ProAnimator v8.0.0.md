**Version 8.0.0 – Major Release:**

* Compatible with After Effects CS5, CS5.5, CS6 and After Effects CC 2014
* Compatible with Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 / OSX 10.7 or above and Intel Mac Only
* Real-Time Rendering
  + Optimized OpenGL and Ray-Traced Renderer- Our OpenGL and Ray Trace Renderer is now faster than ever! Create hundreds of thousands of polygons without having to worry about slowdown. Everything updates in real-time with texturing, lighting and shadows.
  + Auto-Rendering- With Auto-Rendering, whenever you make any changes the scene automatically renders. No need to keep having to click the Render Test button to see what your objects look like.
* Depth of Field – Use Depth of Field to create highly realistic images where some objects are in focus while other objects are out of focus.
* Instancing
  + Instanced Objects- With instanced objects, the program automatically duplicates as many objects as you want without slowing down the program. Objects can be distributed using our distribution tools.
    - New Distribution Types – Use new distribution tools such as assigning your objects totake on the shape of a different object, or other simple shapes such as cubes, spheres and more.
    - Materials – Apply the same material or different materials to the instanced objects.
    - Randomization – Use our randomize controls to place objects in random positions instead of scattering objects one by one.
  + Instanced Text- With instanced text, you can set the text to be instanced by character, word, or paragraphs. This lets you distribute walls of text to create amazing text backgrounds quickly and easily.
* Normal Maps
  + Applying Normal Maps- Our Material Editor gives you the ability to load either a normal map or bump map to create realistic effects.
  + Realistic Material Presets- Our material presets have been re-edited with normal maps for even more realistic effects for your objects.
* New Lighting Controls
  + Image Based Lighting- Apply Image Based Lighting for highly realistic lighting effects for your scene.
  + Shadow Lights- Create a light that doesn’t affect your scene, but has the ability to cast shadows.
* **Note:** Wireframe and Hidden line rendering styles are no longer supported. If you have any projects that are using wireframe or hidden line rendering, the material will render as a solid color instead. You may use the Grid Shader as an alternative for Hidden Line rendering.
